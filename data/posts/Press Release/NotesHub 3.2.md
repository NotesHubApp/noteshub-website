## Interactive checkboxes in the preview

You asked? We hear you. Now you are not required to go into edit mode for your notes just to check/uncheck your tasks. Checkboxes are interactive even in the preview mode.

## New hotkeys for a better editing experience

To provide a better experience when working with a keyboard we added a few useful hotkeys:
- `⌘+E` (Mac) or `Ctrl+E` (Windows) - start editing your note.
- `⌘+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows) - save your note edits.
- `Escape` - exit edit mode.

## Action buttons for code blocks

## Relative links support

## Navigation between documents

## Other notable features
- Adds support for underline HTML tag `<u>` in Markdown.
- Adds syntax highlighting for Ini and VB.NET languages in code blocks for preview.

## Important fixes
- Fixes the reverse order for the next and previous buttons when performing in-note search.
- Fixes the issue when in some scenarios due date was showing the wrong value after the board reopening (Kanban Boards).
