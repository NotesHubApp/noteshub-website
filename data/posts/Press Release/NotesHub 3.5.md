## Apple Vision Pro
NotesHub was available for Apple Vision Pro via an iPad-compatible version from day one. While it worked, the experience was far from perfect. With this release, we are introducing a dedicated Apple Vision Pro app. Even so, there is still room for improvement, this is a significant first step in this direction.

With the new app, you can open files in separate windows to take advantage of the enormous Apple Vision Pro real estate. Windows are resizable now, which can be really handy for Kanban boards or whiteboards. Images in notes could be previewed in full size with the ability to zoom. Lastly, eye tracking works better on menus and other items.
