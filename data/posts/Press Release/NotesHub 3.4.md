Finally, the most requested feature is here. **Search** was one of the few fundamental pieces missing in NotesHub. Let's celebrate the arrival, hurrah ðŸŽ‰

## Search

To start searching for content across all of your files, tap the corresponding icon in the upper right corner. The functionality is available from the notebooks and folder views. When performing the search from inside the folder, you narrow the scope of the operation to that specific folder and all of its subfolders. We also made sure that the search would understand the semantic differences between different types of documents. For instance, for whiteboards, we will look only into text nodes, ignoring all other SVG elements.

The search dialog has a query input field and three sections for quick searches, which are visible at any time when the query is empty.
As a quick search option, you have:
- **Recent searches** - queries will appear here once you have navigated to documents from the corresponding queries.
- **Favorite searches** - here you can find your favorite search queryes, which for convenience, have friendly names; you can add a new favorite search query after performing the search and navigating to `...` then _Add to Favorites_.
- **Tags** - in the final section, you can find all available hashtags for the giving scope; nested tags will be represented in the hierarchical structure; once selected, the search will be performed for a specific hashtag.

### Query syntax
Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and filters, which narrow down the search.
A bare term with no filter will match either the content of a file or the file's name.
To make it more clear, a simple request like `Hello World` is equivalent to `(name:Hello OR content:Hello) AND (name:World OR content:World)`

#### Boolean operations
The search engine supports the following three operators:
- `AND` - returns a combined result only when both left and right subqueries return something; this is a default operator inserted implicitly when there is no other operator between terms.
- `OR` - returns a combined result when left or right subqueries return something.
- `NOT` (`-`) - negation unary operator returns the opposite result of the right subquery.

Since different operators have different priorities, like `AND` has precedence over `OR` operator, you can manage priorities by enclosing your subqueries into parenthesis `()`.

#### Exact phrase match
To search for the exact phrase, including whitespaces, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:
```js
"Hello World"
```
This will ensure those terms are found together and in the right order.

#### Regular expressions
For more advanced scenarios we offer regular expressions support, by surrounding the expression in forward slashes. For example:
```js
/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}Z$/
```
The pattern above will match ISO 8601 date and time string, such as `2020-12-03T15:52:34.000Z`.

#### Query filters

- `name` - matches for a specified text inside of a file's name (without extension).
- `type` - matches the type of the file, accepted values are _note_, _kanban_, _whiteboard_.
- `path` - matches for a specified text inside of the folder path of the file.
- `notebook` - matches for a specified text inside of the notebook name where the file is located.
- `content` - matches for a specified text inside of the content of the file.
- `heading`, `heading1`...`heading6` (`h`, `h1`...`h6`) - matches for a specified text inside of the heading element.
- `tag` - matches for a specified text inside of a hashtag.
- `listitem` (`li`) - matches for a specified text inside of list item.
- `task` - matches for a specified text inside of the task in any state (completed or not).
- `todo` - matches for a specified text inside of the task that is not completed.
- `done` - matches for a specified text inside of the task with the completed state.
- `attachment` (`att`) - searches for attachments inside of the file with a specified type; accepted values are _image_, _audio_, _video_, and _location_.
