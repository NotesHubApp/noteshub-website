## Whiteboard

### Notable features
- Built-in browser for external libraries.
- Double-tap Apple Pencil support.

### Current limitations
- Added library items do not persist between app restarts. This will be fixed in the upcoming version.

## Audio/video playback in Markdown

## Audio recording

## Slash commands

## Autocompletion for callout types

## Autocompletion for emojis

## Accent color

## Subtasks completion progress for Kanban cards

## Other notable features
- New appearance setting: "Show page title on print".
- Adds the ability to favorite folders.
- Adds syntax highlighting for `batch`, `log`, `YAML` languages in code blocks for preview.
- Adds `Tab` button to Markdown toolbar on mobile devices. This could be handy for navigation between placeholders of a snippet. _Example_: navigation between callout type, title, and content when inserting callout via `slash` command.

## Important fixes
- Fixes handling of merge conflicts when folders with the same path have been added/deleted from multiple clients (applies to Git/GitHub notebooks).
- Fixes colors for Mermaid diagrams on the dark theme. Now they will better represent the original colors instead of just inverting them.
- Fixes the issue when a floating menu may appear on a printed note.
- Fixes rendering of task lists in some edge cases.
- Fixes tabs switching for Markdown help panel on Windows.
