## Whiteboard

PLACEHOLDER

## Audio recording

## Slash commands

## Accent color

## Other notable features
- New appearance setting: "Show page title on print".
- Adds the ability to favorite folders.
- Adds syntax highlighting for `batch`, `log`, `YAML` languages in code blocks for preview.
- Adds `Tab` button to Markdown toolbar on mobile devices. This could be handy for navigation between placeholders of a snippet. _Example_: navigation between callout type, title, and content when inserting callout via `slash` command.

## Important fixes
- Fixes handling of merge conflicts when folders with the same path have been added/deleted from multiple clients (applies to Git/GitHub notebooks).
- Fixes colors for Mermaid diagrams on the dark theme. Now they will better represent the original colors instead of just inverting them.
- Fixes the issue when the floating menu may appear on the printed note.
- Fixes rendering of task lists in some edge cases.
- Fixes tabs switching in the Markdown's help panel on Windows.
