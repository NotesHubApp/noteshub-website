## Auto-generated table of contents (TOC)

## Support of ABC musical notation

## Pan & zoom support for Mermaid diagrams

## New settings for editor and preview

## Optimal line length
Many studies show the importance of limiting maximum line length in the text for content readability. If the lines are too short then the text becomes disjointed; if they are too long, the content loses rhythm as the reader searches for the start of each line. That's is why you can see this limit imposed in many blogs, news sites, apps, etc. You can read more about the line length [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length#Electronic_text).
With this release we are introducing new setting **Optimal Line Length** which is turned on by default and will limit lines to 75 characters. You can turn it off in _Settings -> Appearance -> Optimal Line Length_.

## Multi-window support

## Other notable features
- Settings such as theme, language, and others are now synced between tabs/windows on change.

## Important fixes
- Adds support of special characters in username and password when using Git notebook provider.
- The web version of the application now correctly works offline.
- Back/forward navigation with gestures has been added back with better consistency (iOS).
- Fixes compatibility with iOS/iPadOS 15.* (iOS).
