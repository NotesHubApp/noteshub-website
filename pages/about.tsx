            I started thinking about ideas behind the <strong>NotesHub</strong> project in the late Fall of 2020.
              At that time I switched multiple note-taking apps.
              I wanted the app with the robust support of Markdown because it allows me easily migrate my data if needed and strictly control formatting.
              From another hand, I wanted to avoid paying the monthly subscription fee but have good cross-device sync support and ideally fully control my data without being strictly tight to a single particular vendor.
              I have not found any application that would satisfy all my requirements.
              The solution was obvious, create my own.
            </p>
            <p>
              On October 30, 2020, I made the first commit, and 6 months later I pushed the final changes to finalize the MVP version of the project going from the idea to the first stable release.
              The project was finally available to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
            I hope you will enjoy using <strong>NotesHub</strong> as much as I'm enjoying developing it.
